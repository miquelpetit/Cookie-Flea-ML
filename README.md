## Project Description
This project take part in a datathon and is about implement ML. In this case we are told that a company of cookies, Cookie Flea, want to improve the the recipe in order to improve the quality of the cookies and reduce the costs such as money and time.
The point with ML is to predict (with the more convinient model) the quality of the cookie before starting its production.

<a name="hypotheses-/-questions"></a>

## Hypotheses / Questions
We are going to look what are the most important features that affect more importanly to the quality of the cookies. This questions are related to the business aplication


<a name="dataset"></a>

## Dataset
The data has been provided for the teachers from Ironhack in a private way. The dataset in csv format, is compounded by 5198 rows and 22 columns. All with the information of the cookies, for instance physical differences, ingredients and properties that each cookie has. The command used to charge the dataset is "df = pd.read_csv("cookies.csv")".

## Cleaning
We did a first inspection of the dataset and checked the types and NaN values in the differents columns. We dealed with the NaN's, in order to fill up the free spot we used a median to fill up and the outliers. We followed with the creation of dummy columns because there is object types.

<a name="analysis"></a>

## Analysis
* Overview the general steps you will go through to analyze your data in order to test your hypothesis.
* Document each step of your data exploration and analysis.
* Include charts to demonstrate the effect of your work. 
* If you use ML in your final project, describe your feature selection process.

<a name="model-training-and-evaluation"></a>

## Model Training and Evaluation
*Include this section only if you chose to include ML in your project.*
* Describe how you trained your model, the results you obtained, and how you evaluated those results.

<a name="conclusion"></a>

## Conclusion
* Summarize your results. What do they mean?
* What can you say about your hypotheses?
* Interpret your findings in terms of the human-understandable question you try to answer.

<a name="future-work"></a>

## Future Work
Address any questions you were unable to answer, or any next steps or future extensions to your project.

<a name="workflow"></a>

## Workflow
Outline the workflow you used in your project. What were the steps?
How will you test the success of our analysis or algorithm?
